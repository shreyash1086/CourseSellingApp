# Backend of Course Selling App

I have created a Course Selling App backend,    while working on the app I got to learn various things such as user authentication and validation using various `Node.js` libraries like `jsonwebtoken`.  

Used `bcrypt` to generate hash code of password and store that hash code into the `MongoDB` database.

Used `express` `Router()` to modulate the various routes in the application.

Understood the working of `.env` file in coding.

Used `mongoose` library to perform `CRUD` operations in the database.

After completing the backend all the routes are working exactly as expected.
